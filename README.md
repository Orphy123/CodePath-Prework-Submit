## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I watched a few tutorials on YouTube about CSS and JavaScript to help me better understand the project.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I did not encounter that many challenges when working on the project because of my prior experience working with HTML and CSS.
However, I had to do a little more research when working on the javaScript portion of the assessment. 
I watched a few Youtube videos and read the tutorials the prompts on the instructions provided. 
One portion that gave me a bit of an issue while working on the project was trying to get the start and stop buttons to alternate and hide with each other. 
I had a bit of an issue with my startGame() and stopGame() functions, specifically the portion of adding and removing the “hidden” element from the buttons. 
It took me a while to figure it out, but I started working on the code and retook it from the very top because I could not figure out where the error was coming from.
 After further analysis and looking at the code in its entirety, I realized it was not due to any technical problems,
 but it was because I had written the word “start” with a smaller “s” and the word “Stop” with a capital “S.” 
Once I remedied this issue, my code started working perfectly again. The rest of the code went quite smoothly.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I do not have any specific questions, but I am interested in keeping up my study with javascript because I was intrigued by 
what I could do with it on the project. I want to explore just how much I can accomplish with this knowledge.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I started working on this project pretty late and close to the deadline, so, unfortunately, I did not have enough time to work on the optional portion of the assignment,
but if I had a few more hours, I would definitely start there. I want to explore how to implement a timer into the program.
I would like to add some more styles, pictures, and graphics to gamify the website. 
I would like to add a round counter beside the tiles to inform the user of how many rounds he has successfully completed.
If I had enough time, I would like to implement a two-person player version of this game that keeps track of how far each opponent has reached.
I would also like to implement an absurdly large number of rounds.
I would also like to make the game go on for about 1,000 or 10,000 rounds and have a scoreboard with the best player score of all time.
These are a few features I would undoubtedly be interested in developing for this website to make it more interactive and personal.]
